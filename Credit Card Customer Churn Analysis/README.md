# Final Project - Credit Card Customer Analysis

* Please see the "Credit Card Customer Analysis.pdf" as a final report.

* In this project, in addition to the general data preprocessing, summary statistics, correlation analysis and models, some insights were generated from the statistics and plots. In the exploratory data analysis, I identified the features of attrited customers and compared them with existing customers, generated some hypothesis to explain the difference, and proposed some suggestions for the bank. For the classification problem, I trained and tested models using grid search and cross-validation, and evaluated the model performance using recall score. I used flask to implement a web API interface presenting the plots and analysis.

* The "Credit Card Customer Analysis.pdf" contains the codes for data processing, EDA and models.

* The "flask app" folder contains the web API I built using flask. You can run the server and copy the link into the browser to see the webpages showing the plots and analysis results. 

* The structure of the app and the server are as follows:
